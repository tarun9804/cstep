Direct Normal Irradiance(DNI) : or beam radiation, is measured at the surface of the Earth at a given location with a surface element perpendicular to the Sun.[5] It excludes diffuse solar radiation (radiation that is scattered or reflected by atmospheric components). Direct irradiance is equal to the extraterrestrial irradiance above the atmosphere minus the atmospheric losses due to absorption and scattering. Losses depend on time of day (length of light's path through the atmosphere depending on the solar elevation angle), cloud cover, moisture content and other contents. The irradiance above the atmosphere also varies with time of year (because the distance to the sun varies), although this effect is generally less significant compared to the effect of losses on DNI.

Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI), or Diffuse Sky Radiation is the radiation at the Earth's surface from light scattered by the atmosphere. It is measured on a horizontal surface with radiation coming from all points in the sky excluding circumsolar radiation (radiation coming from the sun disk).[5][6] There would be almost no DHI in the absence of atmosphere.[5]

Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is the total irradiance from the sun on a horizontal surface on Earth. It is the sum of direct irradiance (after accounting for the solar zenith angle of the sun z) and diffuse horizontal irradiance
